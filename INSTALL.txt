DATABASE SETUP
--------------

BEFORE creating pool database, the server config needs to be changed.

/etc/my.cnf.d/burstpool.cnf (or equivalent mysql/mariadb server config file):
[server]
character-set-server=utf8
collation-server=utf8_unicode_ci
init-connect="SET NAMES utf8"
wait-timeout=600
max-connections=400
skip-networking="ON"

If using /etc/my.cnf.d then check for this in /etc/my.cnf:
#
# include all files from the config directory
#
!includedir /etc/my.cnf.d


Example burstpool database creation SQL commands, to be run as mysql's "root":

create database burstpool;
grant delete,insert,lock tables,select,update on burstpool.* to BURSTPOOLUSERNAME@localhost identified by 'BURSTPOOLPASSWORD';

Where BURSTPOOLUSERNAME and BURSTPOOLPASSWORD are the same as those in config.js


To create actual database, use supplied 'burstpool.sql' or use DORM's emit_object_SQL thusly:

mysql --user=root -p --database=burstpool < burstpool.sql

OR

build/contrib/DORM/bin/emit_object_SQL objects/*.hpp | mysql --user=root -p --database=burstpool

(You will be prompted for mysql's root password in either case)
